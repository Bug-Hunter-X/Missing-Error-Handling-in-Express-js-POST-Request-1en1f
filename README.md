# Missing Error Handling in Express.js POST Request

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: missing error handling for POST requests. The provided code lacks checks for the validity of request data before processing, which can lead to unexpected behavior or crashes.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js server that handles POST requests to the `/user` endpoint. It logs the received user data but doesn't handle cases where the request body is missing or incomplete. This lack of error handling can result in issues such as:

* **Unhandled exceptions:** If the request body is missing or contains invalid data, the application might crash.
* **Unexpected behavior:** The server might return incorrect responses or fail silently.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with comprehensive error handling. The improved code ensures that:

* The request body is present and contains the necessary data.
* Appropriate error responses (e.g., 400 Bad Request) are returned when issues are detected.
* More informative logging helps to track down and address problems in the future.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Run the buggy code: `node bug.js` (observe the behavior when sending an empty request body).
5. Run the corrected code: `node bugSolution.js` (test with various scenarios to confirm robustness).
